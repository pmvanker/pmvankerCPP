# C++11 Features

C++11, released in 2011, revolutionized C++ with features for better performance, safety, and expressiveness. It introduced automatic type deduction, functional programming elements, memory management improvements, and concurrency support.

## Key Features Added in C++11

- **Auto Type Deduction**: Simplifies variable declarations.
- **Lambda Expressions**: Anonymous functions for callbacks and algorithms.
- **Smart Pointers**: Automatic memory management with `unique_ptr`, `shared_ptr`, `weak_ptr`.
- **Move Semantics**: Efficient resource transfer with rvalue references.
- **Constexpr**: Compile-time evaluation.
- **Variadic Templates**: Templates with variable arguments.
- **Range-Based For Loop**: Simplified iteration.
- **Initializer Lists**: Uniform initialization syntax.
- **Nullptr**: Type-safe null pointer.
- **Enum Class**: Scoped enumerations.
- **Override and Final**: Polymorphism safety.
- **Threads and Futures**: Basic concurrency.
- **Regex**: Pattern matching.
- **Random**: Random number generation.
- **Atomic**: Lock-free operations.
- **Condition Variable**: Thread synchronization.

Each subdirectory contains an example `.cpp` file and a `README.md` with detailed explanations.
