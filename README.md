# ModernCpp

This project demonstrates modern C++ features from C++11 onwards, organized by standard version. Each feature has its own directory with an example `.cpp` file and a `README.md` explaining the concept, use cases, how to use it, methods, benefits, and cons.

## Roadmap: Where to Start

1. **Begin with C++11**: Start here if you're new to modern C++. It introduces the foundational changes from C++03.
   - Key features: Auto type deduction, lambdas, smart pointers, move semantics.
   - Why? These are the most impactful for everyday coding.

2. **Explore C++14**: Builds on C++11 with improvements and new features.
   - Key features: Enhanced chrono with literals, std::make_unique.
   - Why? Adds convenience and performance tweaks.

3. **Look at C++17**: More utilities like filesystem and optional.
   - Key features: Filesystem, optional.
   - Why? Simplifies common tasks.

4. **Advanced C++20**: Concepts and ranges for better templates.
   - Key features: Concepts, ranges.
   - Why? Modern, expressive code.

5. **STL Deep Dive**: Additional containers and algorithms.
   - Why? Comprehensive understanding of the library.

6. **Best Practices**: Learn good habits and avoid common pitfalls.
   - Why? Write robust, maintainable code.

7. **Build and Run**:

5. **Learn Order**: Follow the directories in std11/ for a logical progression from basic syntax to advanced STL and concurrency.

Each feature's README.md includes code snippets, explanations, and examples.
