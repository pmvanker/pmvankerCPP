# Const Correctness

## Explanation
Use const to indicate immutability.

## Good Practice
- Const methods, parameters, variables.

## Common Mistakes to Avoid
- Non-const where const suffices.
- Casting away const.

## What Not to Miss
- Const in function signatures.
- Const member functions.

## What to Take Care
- Logical vs bitwise const.

## Example
See `const_correctness_example.cpp` for proper const usage.
