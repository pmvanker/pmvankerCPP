# Question 9: What are functions in C++? How are they defined and called?

**What are functions in C++? How are they defined and called?**
   - **Answer/Explanation:** Functions are blocks of code that perform specific tasks. They are defined with a return type, name, parameters, and body.
   - **Code Example:**
     ```cpp
     int add(int a, int b) {
         return a + b;
     }
     int main() {
         int result = add(3, 4);
         return 0;
     }
     ```
   - **Key Concepts:** Function signature, parameters, return values.
   - **Problem-Solving Technique:** Modular programming.
