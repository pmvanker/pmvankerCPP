# Question 2: What are the basic data types in C++?

**What are the basic data types in C++?**
   - **Answer/Explanation:** Basic data types include int (integer), float (single-precision floating-point), double (double-precision floating-point), char (character), bool (boolean), and void.
   - **Code Example:**
     ```cpp
     int a = 10;
     float b = 3.14f;
     double c = 3.14159;
     char d = 'A';
     bool e = true;
     ```
   - **Key Concepts:** Data types, memory allocation.
   - **Problem-Solving Technique:** Choosing appropriate data types for variables.
