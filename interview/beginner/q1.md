# Question 1: What is C++? Difference from C?

## Problem
Explain C++ and its differences from C.

## Solution
C++ is an extension of C with OOP features.

### Differences:
- OOP: Classes, inheritance, polymorphism.
- Templates for generics.
- STL for containers/algorithms.
- Exception handling.
- References, operator overloading.

### Code Example
```cpp
#include <iostream>
int main() {
    std::cout << "Hello, C++!" << std::endl;
    return 0;
}
```

### Key Concepts
- Procedural vs OOP.
- Backward compatibility with C.

### Problem-Solving Technique
- Compare features systematically.
