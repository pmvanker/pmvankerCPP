**What are operators in C++? Give examples.**
   - **Answer/Explanation:** Operators are symbols that perform operations on variables and values. Types include arithmetic, relational, logical, assignment, etc.
   - **Code Example:**
     ```cpp
     int a = 10, b = 5;
     int sum = a + b;  // arithmetic
     bool greater = a > b;  // relational
     bool result = (a > b) && (b < 10);  // logical
     ```
   - **Key Concepts:** Operator precedence, associativity.
   - **Problem-Solving Technique:** Understanding operator behavior.
