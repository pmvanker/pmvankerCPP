# Question 17: Explain range-based for loops.

**Explain range-based for loops.**
    - **Answer/Explanation:** Range-based for loops iterate over containers without explicit iterators.
    - **Code Example:**
      ```cpp
      std::vector<int> v = {1, 2, 3};
      for (int x : v) {
          std::cout << x;
      }
      ```
    - **Key Concepts:** Container iteration.
    - **Problem-Solving Technique:** Simplified loops.
